This project aims to develop a comprehensive Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard that leverages two primary data sources, namely Orders and Details. The dataset encompasses sales-related information such as Order ID, Category, Region, Date of Purchase, and Transaction Amount. The primary objectives include data preprocessing, connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, adding calculated columns and measures, and designing an interactive and insightful report.
## Tasks Performed:
The following tasks were executed as part of the project:

**Connecting and Shaping the Source Data:**
- Integrated data from Orders and Details datasets to form a cohesive dataset.
- Cleaned and transformed data for consistency and coherence.

**Building a Relational Model:**
